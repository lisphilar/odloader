# ODLoader
ODLoader (`odloader`) is an open source Python library for open data analysis.

## Functionality
We have many open data, but it is difficult to use them effectively because of different data formats and download methods. Hirokazu Takaya and ODLoader Development Team published COVID-19 data in Japan and `covsirphy` Python library for COVID-19 data analysis [here](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir) and found many challenges in data engineering.

ODLoader has the following functionalities to overcome the challenges in data science.

- to download datasets and save them at local directry
  - (expected) with URLs
  - (expected) pre-registered open data providers
- (expected) to record data source information to configuration file
- (expected) to update local data if reqired
- to provide data engineering tools
  - (expected) tools for exploratory data analysis
  - (expected) tools for data cleaning
